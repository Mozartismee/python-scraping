This repository contains code samples for the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920078067.do">Web Scraping with Python 2nd Edition</a>, along with beginner-friendly explanations and figures to make the original code more readable.

In addition to providing clearer code samples, I have also connected this project to the GPT-4 API to enhance its functionality.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have about this book or web scraping in general!
